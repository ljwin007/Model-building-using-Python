Univariate and Multivariate Analysis- Mean, Median, Range, IQR, Standard Deviation, Frequency Distribution, Cross-tabulation, Plots
Missing value and Outlier Treatment- Checked for missing value, outliers in a dataset and performed imputation
Variable Transformation-Combined categories of variables with percentage of observations below 5%
Predictive Modelling-Used Decision Tree model. Performed data pre-processing, fitting the model on a train dataset, using it on a test dataset to make predictions and result analysis. The model's accuracy on test dataset achieved was 76.5%
